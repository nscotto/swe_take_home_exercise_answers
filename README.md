# SWE Take Home Exercise Answers

Here are the answers to the [swe take home exercise](https://github.com/Kheiron-Medical/swe_take_home_exercise).

I used an Anaconda environment, an environment file is provided in this repo.

Otherwise I used python 3.9 and installed flask 1.1 as well as urllib3 version 1.25.

## Setup

Using conda:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate flask
```
## Verification

```
python calculator.py
```

## Run the app (bonus)

```
python app.py
```

then go to your browser, [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
